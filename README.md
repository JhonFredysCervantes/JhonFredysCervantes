# Who I am?

I am currently a student about to graduate from the Systems Engineering program.

Lately I have gained experience for more than a year in the development of integrations for information systems related to electronic commerce.

I have also participated in projects that involved solutions applying machine learning, a subject in which I am very interested.

Below I present some of the languages, programs, methodology, etc, with which I have worked.
